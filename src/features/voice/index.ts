// Voice — the page side of the voice assistant (docs/VOICE.md; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §2.3).
// Rust is ears, mouth and engines (crates/voice); this page is language and actions (VOICE §3.1).
// Nothing runs at import: everything begins in `start` and ends in the function it returns.
//
// Two things live here.
// 1. The contract with crates/voice/src/lib.rs, as types: the events it sends (`VoiceEvents`), the
//    methods it takes (`VoiceMethods`) and the settings of its manifest (`VoiceSettings`). Both halves
//    are written against these names; a change on one side is a change on the other.
// 2. The wiring: which module gives the feature its activity, its window page, its settings page, its
//    own actions, and what `start` starts. Every module is one package's (VOICE §10) and exports its
//    final signatures from the first day, so no package edits another's file.
//
// Owned by the package voice-runner (with turn.ts, runner.ts, registry.ts, base-actions.ts). The turn
// loop and the runner know neither the registry nor the models: `start` hands them over, so they run
// under `node --test` (this file, with its stylesheet and `import.meta.glob` behind it, does not).
